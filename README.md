# COVID Model in the Australian Context

**** SEE NOTES ON ODD PROTOCOL BELOW IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR IT ****

If you are looking for the ODD protocol and this link does not work: https://github.com/JTHooker/COVIDModel/blob/master/ODD%20Protocol%20Aus%20NZ%20COVID19%20model.pdf , please see instructions below.

************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

This is an Agent-Based Model being built to assist with modeling the spread, health and economic impact of COVID 19 in Australia and policy-settings during its expansion and contraction phase that could limit its damage.

The model is being built as data comes to hand. At all times it should be regarded as a work in progress and should not be relied upon as a sole basis for decision-making. Like all models, it should be compared to the available observed evidence and considered alongside other inputs. While we have calibrated it against historical patterns in Australia, China, and NZ, and strive to ensure its accuracy, we can of course make no absolute current guarantees about its validity.

There are multiple versions of the model available in the repository - all of which have slightly different purposes and were built to answer slightly different questions.

The core model 'COVID Simuls' is the most generic and was set up to answer early questions from a 'whole of Australia' perspective.

'COVID SIMULS VIC' is the most recent model, and includes additional features and functions relevant to the unfolding 'second wave' in the state of Victoria.

The ODD protocol has been built on the Australian model and will be updated over time to reflect additional functions and features as new questions are asked of the model. You should look for the most recent version of the ODD protocol available in the repository for the most recent version as the url for this will be updated over time.

The team contributing to this model is promarily based at the University of Melbourne, with input from the University of New England and various other contributors from institutions around Australia and the World. It is made up of Epidemiologists, data scientists, computational social scientists, and social scientists. 

The model will be updated regularly as it is constructed.
